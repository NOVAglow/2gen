NOTES:

excludeKeyFileName is an argument for list (array) of files
that the user chooses to exclude those keys in the file(s),
or another word, avoid creating a key that is similar to any
key in the files

If excludeKeyFileName is null, there's no exception
If it is not, the program will avoid creating similar keys
by scanning through the files whose names are in excludeKeyFileName,
and if there's one matching, the program will try to create another
random key, using a while loop.
