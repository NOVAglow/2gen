# 2Gen
Extended password generator

## Distributing 2Gen
I am thinking of distributing 2Gen into 3 distributions: CLI, GUI and both  
I am working on rewriting the code so that 2Gen can be called from the terminal with arguments passed in the command  
So, instead of:
```
$ twogen
2Gen $ 
```
I am making it to be like...
```
$ twogen generate password -d 3 -uc -lc -n

LwKnBwMZkC
LwKnBwMZkC
$
```

## Status
- Missing GUI  
- Untested

## Notes
Tab size is 4. For source files, add ```?ts=4``` to the URL.
